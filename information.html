            <h2>Personally About Us</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1985 by the Roth family, Appliance Warehouse was opened as an inviting atmosphere for purchasing large home appliances. Replacement of large appliances can be very stressful to a homeowner. AW is a family business that strives to gently guide each customer through the purchasing process. Working home appliances are critical to our everyday lives. We understand how disruptive a broken appliance or remodel can be and our goal is to simplify the process for each and every customer.</p>
